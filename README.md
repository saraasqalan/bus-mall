This site acts as a tool for market researchers to know which of their products hold the most interest for customers. Out of their catalog, three items will be displayed to a user, who will choose the item that most interests them out of that group. This will be repeated 25 times, and then the results of the input will be shown. Items will indicate how many times they were chosen, as well as the percentage of how often they were picked when they were shown.
